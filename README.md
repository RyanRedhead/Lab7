Lab 7
======
#Purpose

To build code that uses the IR sensors on the robot and the LEDs on the MSP430 to determine how close it is to a wall. To characterize each IR sensor since there is a lot of variation between each. And to create a ADC10 Library for general use. 

#Hardware Schematic



#Debugging

There was not a lot of debugging for this lab, the most difficult section I had trouble with was getting the correct light conditions. Small shadows had an effect on what the IR was reading. 

#Testing Methedology/Results



##Required Functionality

Required Funct- Check

A/B Funct - Sent to Dr York via email, Check

#Observations/Conclusions

The ADC10 Library will help setup Lab 8 when the IR sensors direct what the motors should be doing.

##Documentation
None
